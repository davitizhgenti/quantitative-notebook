# My Quantitative Finance Journey

This repository documents my personal journey and experimentation in the field of quantitative finance. It serves as a public log of my learning process, blending academic concepts with practical, hands-on testing.

The primary goal is to explore, test, and refine trading ideas using a data-driven approach. The content is presented through a series of notebooks, each aiming to explain my findings and thought process on a specific topic.

### About the Content

Inside, you will find my personal notes and code related to quantitative analysis. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Statistical analysis of market data
* Development of systematic trading strategies
* Implementation of backtesting environments
* Exploration of financial theories and academic papers

As this repository tracks my learning process, the strategies and conclusions are experimental and subject to significant change as my understanding evolves.

### Repository Structure

The research is organized into a main `notebooks` directory, which is further divided by topic. Each topic folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that build upon each other.
